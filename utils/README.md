## utils

This folder contains all helper scripts used to process txt files and generate scores.

- ```get_accuracy_score.py``` : This script calculates the accuracy score for the generated outputs.
```bash
python3 get_accuracy_score.py --input_file genertated_output/file_name.txt
```
- ```convert_files.py``` : The perplexity scores are obtained using the teacher LM from the ```diffusion-lm```. The input has to be in a particular format, with each sentence on a new line and with eos tag. To convert the ```generated_output/``` to ```perplex_score_input/``` use the command below.

To retokenize with diffusion LM tokenizer: 
```bash
python3 convert_files.py --input_file generated_output/file_name.txt --handleUNK True
```

To convert as is :
```bash
python3 convert_files.py --input_file generated_output/file_name.txt 
```
-

- ```fix_json.py``` : This file can be used to process the output file generated by diffusion-lm. 

- ```classifier_report.py``` : This can be used to generate the accuracy metrics for the classifiers for FUDGE.
